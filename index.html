                Welcome to Brand Central Station! In our daily lives we’re constantly flooded with branding. We’ve come to expect it, and when it’s not there, something’s off. If you’re making an app or starting a business, you need a brand. Brand Central Station is a tool to get you started. These early brand standards will put your work on the right track and set you up for future success. Let me handle the branding so you can get back to doing what you love.

              <h2 style="color:black"> 1. First thing's first, we need to start with a color.</h2>

              <p >
                  What’s a brand without a color? It’s nothing. Think about Target red. Or Facebook blue. You know exactly what these colors look like and they form the basis for their branding. Developing a consistent color palette is easy to do and goes a long way. I’ll do that for you, just pick one of these random colors.

                <p >
                    What’s a brand without a good font kit? Well honestly, you’ll probably be okay, but why not get this sorted out now? Do you work in tech? You’ll probably want a modern, sans-serif font. (These are the simpler ones, like Arial.) Are you starting a calligraphy venture? Probably not. But if you’re doing anything outside of tech, look to serif fonts too (like Times New Roman.) If chosen appropriately, fonts can convey who you are  without making others actually read the words they form. Pick one of the pretty fonts below and I'll pair them with others so you  end up with a nice collection.

                  I’m doing this to collect data on you and then sell it. That’s obviously not the case, I don’t know how to do that. I’m going to find some high quality and free stock images that you can use. Maybe on your website? Or app? Or newsletter? If you use an image enough, people will start to associate it with your brand, which is a good thing. Type in your industry and click submit to finish the process!
